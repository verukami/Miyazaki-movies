                <li><h3 id="headline"><strong>1. Porco Rosso (1992)</strong></h3>

                    <p> Might be a tougher sell visually than most other Ghibli films, given that its protagonist is an obese pig in World War 1 flight gear. True to its “Change my looks but not my heart” tagline, though, Porco Rosso reveals itself to be one of Miyazaki’s most directly entertaining movies. It’s a straight-up comedy that finds space to touch on the horrors of fascism, the misogyny of the era, and the freedom of flight.

                    <p>Is Studio Ghibli’s take on an Akira Kurosawa-style war epic. It doesn’t quite get there for me, suffering from a bloated running time and a sprawling plot that loses sight of the intimate details that make Ghibli’s best works so impactful. But there’s no denying the scale of the ambition and the achievement — it’s a visually amazing movie that shows Miyazaki accelerating his powers ahead of Spirited Away.

                    <p>Meanwhile, is what followed Spirited Away, and it’s of a piece with Princess Mononoke — a stunning but unfocused epic. This film is all over the place plot-wise, but it’s never less than gorgeous to look at, and thematically it feels like Miyazaki’s id spilled out onto the screen. Anti-war messages, the joy of flying, a suspicion of technology — it’s all here. And the moving castle itself is one of Ghibli’s most vividly realized creations.
